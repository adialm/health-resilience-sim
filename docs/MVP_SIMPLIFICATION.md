- Color-coded progress bars (green = improvement)
- Removed distracting AI/recommendations for now

### **Professional Center:**

## 💻 File Changes

### Modified:
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/layout/LeftPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/layout/RightPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/layout/CenterPanel.tsx`
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

### Created:
- ✅ `frontend/src/constants/zipCodeData.ts` (NEW!)

### Data Available:
```typescript
// 7 ZIP codes with full health data
bostonZipCodes: ZipCodeHealthData[]

// City-wide averages for comparison  
cityWideAverages
```

---

## 🚀 What This Enables

### **For Your Team:**
1. **Clear scope**: 7 ZIPs, 5 diseases - that's it
2. **Data-ready**: All ZIP codes have realistic health data
3. **Intervention testing**: Add clinics/hospitals to specific ZIPs
4. **Policy testing**: Adjust access and funding levels
5. **Disease tracking**: See impact on all 5 diseases
6. **Comparison**: Before/after, ZIP vs. city average

### **For Development:**
1. **Backend can start**: Clear data structure to work with
2. **Simulation logic**: Focus on core algorithms
3. **No distractions**: Removed all "nice-to-have" features
4. **Faster iteration**: Simpler UI = easier to test

### **For Demo:**
1. **Clear message**: "Simulate interventions across 7 Boston ZIPs"
2. **Tangible scope**: People understand 7 areas
3. **Multiple diseases**: Shows breadth (not just cancer)
4. **Professional look**: Clean, focused, purposeful

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Immediate (Your Team):**
1. ✅ Decide on simulation formulas
2. ✅ Connect backend API to these ZIP codes
3. ✅ Make "Run Simulation" button functional
4. ✅ Test with real interventions

### **After MVP Works:**
- Add map visualization (optional)
- Add save/load scenarios
- Add real AI insights
- Add animation/timeline
- Add more ZIP codes

## 📝 How to Use the New Structure

### **Example: Testing an Intervention**

```typescript
// User flow:
1. Select "02134 - Allston" from ZIP dropdown
2. Click "Add Clinic"
3. Adjust "Healthcare Access" slider to 80%
4. Set "Duration" to 5 years
5. Click "Run Simulation"

// Backend receives:
{
  zipCode: "02134",
  interventions: [{ type: "clinic", ... }],
  policyChanges: { healthcareAccess: 80, funding: 40 },
  duration: 5
}

// Backend returns:
{
  diseases: {
    cancer: { reductionPercent: 12 },
    diabetes: { reductionPercent: 8 },
    heartDisease: { reductionPercent: 15 },
    respiratory: { reductionPercent: 10 },
    mentalHealth: { reductionPercent: 5 }
  },
  metrics: {
    mortalityRate: 3.2,
    hospitalCapacity: 85,
    accessScore: 7.1,
    resilienceScore: 8.2
  }
}

// UI updates right panel automatically
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **State Management**
Still using Zustand - all the store infrastructure is intact, just simplified UI on top.

### **TypeScript Types**
New interfaces in `zipCodeData.ts`:
- `ZipCodeHealthData`
- Disease-specific metrics
- Healthcare access data

### **Component Architecture**
- **Modular**: Each panel is independent
- **Reusable**: KPI cards, progress bars
- **Extensible**: Easy to add features back later

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### **For Demos:**
- Start with "Let me show you our 7 Boston ZIP codes..."
- Pick Allston (02134) - highest cancer rate
- Add a clinic, run simulation
- Show the 5 disease impacts
- Highlight the 12% cancer reduction

### **For Development:**
- Start with mock data (already included!)
- Hard-code initial results if needed
- Get the flow working first
- Add real algorithms incrementally

### **For Testing:**
- Each ZIP has realistic baseline data
- You can compare high-risk (Allston, Roxbury) vs. low-risk (South End)
- All 5 diseases have different rates per ZIP

## ✨ Summary

**Before:** Complex dashboard with maps, timelines, AI, recommendations, events, overlays...

**After:** Focused MVP with:
- 7 ZIP codes clearly listed
- 3 intervention types
- 2 policy levers
- 5 disease outcomes
- 4 core metrics
- 1 clear goal: Test interventions

**Result:** Your team can now focus 100% on the simulation logic without UI distractions. When that works, everything else is easy to add back!

---

## 🎉 You're MVP-Ready!

The dashboard is now:
- ✅ Simpler
- ✅ Focused
- ✅ Professional
- ✅ ZIP code-based
- ✅ Multi-disease
- ✅ Ready for core logic

**Go build that simulation engine!** 🚀
