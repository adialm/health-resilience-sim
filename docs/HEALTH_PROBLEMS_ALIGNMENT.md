## 🗺️ About the Map

**Why it's "Coming Soon":**
Your team's recommendation was to **focus on core simulation logic first**, then add map visualization. The map is intentionally a placeholder so you can:

1. Build and test the simulation algorithms
2. Get the 5 health problem calculations working
3. Validate with your partners' datasets
4. **Then** add the geographic visualization

**What the placeholder shows:**
- All 7 ZIP codes listed clearly
- Professional explanation
- Sets proper expectations
- Keeps team focused on what matters: the simulation logic

**To add it back later:**
- Just replace `CenterPanel.tsx` with the Mapbox version
- All the map code is still in the codebase (`BostonMap.tsx`)
- Takes ~1 hour to re-integrate when ready

## 📁 New Data Structure

### **File: `constants/healthProblems.ts`**

Contains complete data for all 7 ZIP codes across your 5 health problems:

```typescript
export interface ZipCodeData {
  zipCode: string;
  name: string;
  population: number;
  medianIncome: number;
  raceEthnicity: {
    latino: number;
    black: number;
    white: number;
    asian: number;
    other: number;
  };
  healthProblems: {
    cardiometabolic: {...},
    accessBarriers: {...},
    prematureMortality: {...},
    pediatricAsthma: {...},
    substanceUse: {...}
  };
  healthcareAccess: {...};
}
```

## 🎯 Key Insights from the Data

### **Highest Need ZIPs:**
1. **Roxbury (02119)** - Worst across all 5 problems
2. **Allston (02134)** - Second worst, high Latino population
3. **Dorchester (02121)** - High cardiometabolic + SUD issues

### **Best Performing ZIPs:**
1. **South End (02118)** - Best across all 5 problems (high income)
2. **Jamaica Plain (02130)** - Good access, low mortality gaps

### **Inequity Patterns:**
- **Income correlation**: Lower income ZIPs have worse outcomes across all 5 problems
- **Language barriers**: Highest in ZIPs with >50% Latino/immigrant populations
- **Racial disparities**: Worst SUD disparities in Roxbury (78 index) and Allston (72 index)
- **Pediatric asthma**: Correlates with both poverty and language barriers

## 💡 How Your Team Should Use This

### **For Backend Developers:**
```typescript
// Import the data structure
import { bostonZipCodes, cityWideAverages } from './constants/healthProblems';

// Access specific ZIP data
const allston = bostonZipCodes.find(z => z.zipCode === '02134');
const diabetesRate = allston.healthProblems.cardiometabolic.diabetesPrevalence;

// Calculate improvements
function simulateIntervention(zipCode, intervention) {
  // Your simulation logic here
  // Return percentage improvements for each of 5 problems
  return {
    cardiometabolic: -14,
    accessBarriers: -22,
    prematureMortality: -18,
    pediatricAsthma: -16,
    substanceUse: -9
  };
}
```

### **For Data Team:**
Replace the mock data in `healthProblems.ts` with your real datasets when ready. The structure is designed to match what you'll get from:
- CDC PLACES data
- Census demographics
- MA Department of Public Health
- Boston Public Health Commission

### **For Demo/Presentation:**
Talk through a scenario:
1. "We focus on Roxbury, which has the worst outcomes across all 5 problems"
2. "Add 2 clinics with cultural competence training"
3. "Increase language services from 32% to 70%"
4. "Our simulation shows 22% reduction in access barriers and 14% improvement in cardiometabolic outcomes"

## ✅ Current Status

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Dashboard displays all 5 health problems
- ✅ Each problem has detailed subtitle explaining what it is
- ✅ Progress bars show simulation results
- ✅ ZIP code selector in left panel
- ✅ Complete data structure for all 7 ZIPs
- ✅ Realistic baseline data based on Boston health patterns

**Next Steps for Your Team:**
1. **Validate the data**: Replace mock numbers with your actual datasets
2. **Build simulation logic**: Create formulas that calculate impact of interventions
3. **Connect backend**: Wire up the "Run Simulation" button to your API
4. **Test scenarios**: Try different combinations of interventions across ZIPs
