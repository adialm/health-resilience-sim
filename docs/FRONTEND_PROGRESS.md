## 📊 Current State

### **Working Demo:**
The app should now be running at: http://localhost:3000

You can:
1. See the complete dashboard layout
2. Toggle map overlays
3. Adjust policy sliders
4. Click "Run Simulation" (simulates progress)
5. View KPI metrics
6. Interact with timeline controls

### **What's NOT Working Yet:**
- ❌ Actual map rendering (Mapbox integration needed)
- ❌ Clickable neighborhoods
- ❌ Real simulation backend calls
- ❌ Adding interventions to map
- ❌ Scenario saving/loading
- ❌ Chart visualizations (planned for Phase 2)
- ❌ Modal dialogs for configurations

## 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **Phase 2: Map Integration** (Next Priority)
- [ ] Set up Mapbox account and get API key
- [ ] Install `mapbox-gl` and types
- [ ] Create BostonMap component
- [ ] Render neighborhood polygons
- [ ] Add click handlers for neighborhoods
- [ ] Implement choropleth coloring based on risk
- [ ] Add hover tooltips
- [ ] Create intervention markers

### **Phase 3: Interactive Features**
- [ ] Build "Add Clinic" modal with configuration
- [ ] Implement drag-to-map for interventions
- [ ] Connect policy sliders to state updates
- [ ] Add intervention markers to map
- [ ] Create event configuration modal
- [ ] Implement scenario save/load

### **Phase 4: Charts & Visualizations**
- [ ] Create TrendChart component (Recharts)
- [ ] Add comparison bar charts
- [ ] Implement time-series visualization
- [ ] Add neighborhood comparison views

### **Phase 5: Backend Integration**

## 🎯 Key Achievements

1. **Professional UI**: Dashboard looks polished and production-ready
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clean component separation
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
4. **State Management**: Centralized Zustand store
5. **Design System**: Consistent MUI theming
6. **Mock Data**: Realistic Boston neighborhood data
7. **Interactive**: Multiple working controls and toggles
8. **Responsive**: Layout adapts to content

## 💡 Tips for Your Partners

### **When they find the top 5 problems:**
You can easily update the metrics displayed by:
1. Editing `/src/constants/mockData.ts`
2. Adding new metric fields to the `Neighborhood` type
3. Updating the RightPanel to display new metrics

### **When they find datasets:**
1. Add data loading functions to `/src/services/dataService.ts`
2. Update the store to fetch real data
3. Replace mock neighborhoods with actual data

### **To demo to them:**
1. Show the live dashboard at localhost:3000
2. Walk through the layout: "Here's where your data will appear"
3. Show interactive elements: toggles, sliders, buttons
4. Explain: "We just need to connect your datasets here"
