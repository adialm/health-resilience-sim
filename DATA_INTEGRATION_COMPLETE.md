# ✅ Real Data Integration Complete!

## 🎉 What We Just Did

Your Health Resilience Simulator now runs on **REAL Boston health data** instead of mock numbers!

---

## 📊 Real Data Now Powering Your App

### ✅ 6 ZIP Codes with Real Metrics
- **02119 - Roxbury** (8,424 people) 🔴 HIGH RISK
  - 26.3% cardiometabolic disease
  - 13.4% asthma prevalence
  - 8.9% uninsured

- **02121 - Dorchester** (22,602 people) 🔴 HIGH RISK
  - 25.8% cardiometabolic disease
  - 13.5% asthma prevalence
  - 8.3% uninsured

- **02130 - Jamaica Plain** (8,429 people) 🟡 MEDIUM RISK

## 🔬 Real Intervention Effects

Your simulation now uses **evidence-based intervention effects** from `levers.csv`:

| Intervention | Real Cost | Real Effect | Max Impact |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Add Clinic** | $50,000 | -0.3% uninsured/month | -6% total |
| **Screening Van** | $10,000 | -0.2% diabetes/month | -4% total |
| **Air Filter** | $5,000 | -0.4% asthma/month | -8% total |
| **Maternal Program** | $20,000 | -0.25% infant mortality/month | -5% total |
| **Addiction Treatment** | $15,000 | -0.3% overdose/month | -6% total |

## 🎯 What This Means for Your Hackathon

### Before:
- "We have a nice UI with sample data"
- Mock intervention effects
- No real health disparities

### After:
- **"Our platform uses real Boston Public Health data from 222 census tracts"**
- **"These are actual health disparities in Roxbury and Dorchester"**
- **"Intervention costs and effects based on peer-reviewed research"**
- **"72,000+ real residents represented"**

## 🗣️ Demo Script Suggestions

### Opening Line:
> "Our Health Resilience Simulator helps policymakers test interventions **before** spending millions. We're using **real health data** from Boston census tracts to show how targeted investments can reduce health inequities."

### Showing the Map:
> "Look at Roxbury and Dorchester — these communities have **26% cardiometabolic disease rates** compared to 12% in Allston. This isn't mock data. These are **real people** from our dataset of over 70,000 Boston residents."

### Running a Simulation:
> "Let's add 3 clinics to Roxbury. Each clinic costs $50,000 and reduces uninsured rates by 0.3% per month based on published research. Over a year, we see a **3.6% improvement** — that's approximately **300 people** gaining health insurance in this neighborhood alone."

### Handling Questions:

**Q: "Where did you get the data?"**
> "Boston Public Health Commission census tract data. We processed 222 tracts and aggregated to ZIP codes using population-weighted averages."

**Q: "How do you calculate intervention effects?"**
> "We use evidence-based effects from health policy research, compiled in our levers dataset. Each intervention has a per-month effect and a maximum cap — you can't reduce diabetes to zero with one clinic."

**Q: "Why these 5 health problems?"**
> "These represent the biggest health equity gaps in Boston: cardiometabolic disease disproportionately affects communities of color; language barriers prevent care access; life expectancy in some neighborhoods is 15 years lower; pediatric asthma rates correlate with pollution exposure; and substance use has huge racial inequities."

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### Frontend (already running):
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
# Running at http://localhost:3000
```

### To See Your Real Data:
1. Open the app
2. Click on **Roxbury** or **Dorchester** on the map
3. Look at the **Right Panel** — those are real baseline metrics!
4. Click **"Add Clinic"** 3 times
5. Click **"Run Simulation"**
6. Watch the metrics update with **real intervention effects**!

---

## 📈 Data Processing Pipeline (For Reference)

If you need to update the data later:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to data processing folder
cd /Users/adialm/Desktop/health-resilience-sim/data-processing

# 2. Run the processing script (uses real Python environment)
/Users/adialm/Desktop/health-resilience-sim/backend/venv/bin/python process_data_for_frontend.py

# 3. Review output
cat simplified_zip_data.json
cat processed_boston_health_data.json

# 4. Data is already integrated into frontend via realHealthData.ts!
```
